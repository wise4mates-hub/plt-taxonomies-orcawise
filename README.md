# ðŸ§  PLT Taxonomies â€“ Orcawise  
**Research and Implementation on Semantic Analysis, Taxonomy Extraction, and Plain Language Techniques**

---

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This repository hosts research, experiments, and implementation code for **semantic analysis**, **taxonomy extraction**, and **plain language transformation** under the Orcawise PLT initiative.  
The primary goal is to improve the interpretability and consistency of language models by developing structured taxonomies and plain-language mappings for domain-specific text.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
1. Develop robust pipelines for **semantic similarity** and **taxonomy construction**.  
2. Explore **plain language techniques** for simplifying technical terminology.  
3. Conduct **model audits** to evaluate bias, consistency, and explainability in language models.  
4. Benchmark approaches using public datasets and academic resources (e.g. [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com)).
