# 🧠 PLT Taxonomies – Orcawise  
**Research and Implementation on Semantic Analysis, Taxonomy Extraction, and Plain Language Techniques**

---

## 📘 Overview
This repository hosts research, experiments, and implementation code for **semantic analysis**, **taxonomy extraction**, and **plain language transformation** under the Orcawise PLT initiative.  
The primary goal is to improve the interpretability and consistency of language models by developing structured taxonomies and plain-language mappings for domain-specific text.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Develop robust pipelines for **semantic similarity** and **taxonomy construction**.  
2. Explore **plain language techniques** for simplifying technical terminology.  
3. Conduct **model audits** to evaluate bias, consistency, and explainability in language models.  
4. Benchmark approaches using public datasets and academic resources (e.g. [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com)).

🧠 Methodology
1. Semantic Analysis

Use transformer-based models (e.g. BERT, RoBERTa) to identify and cluster semantically related terms.
Compute cosine similarity and build term-to-concept mappings.

2. Taxonomy Extraction

Apply hierarchical clustering and rule-based extraction to build domain-specific taxonomies.
Integrate keyword taxonomy generation for better NLP model interpretability.

3. Plain Language Techniques

Simplify complex or technical text using paraphrasing models.
Evaluate simplification quality via readability metrics (e.g. FKGL, SARI).

🧮 Model Audit

Bias detection and interpretability using SHAP and LIME.
Evaluate model fairness, explainability, and consistency with Orcawise standards.

🔗 Data Sources

Internal Orcawise datasets (if applicable).

Open datasets (e.g. Wikipedia, academic corpora, PaperWithCode abstracts).

Domain-specific vocabularies and taxonomies (e.g. WordNet, ConceptNet).

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/wise4mates-hub/plt-taxonomies-orcawise.git
cd plt-taxonomies-orcawise

2. Set Up Environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # (on macOS/Linux)
venv\Scripts\activate      # (on Windows)
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run a Notebook

Open notebooks/semantic_analysis.ipynb to start exploring the pipeline.

🧭 Future Work

Integrate semantic search and visualization dashboards.

Develop a plain-language conversion microservice for Orcawise PLT.

Evaluate taxonomies against real-world business domain cases.

✅ **Result on GitHub:**  
- All major sections (Overview, Objectives, Project Structure, Methodology, Model Audit, etc.) are same heading size (H2).  
- Subsections (like “1. Semantic Analysis”) are smaller (H3).  
- No part is stuck in a code block.  
- Emojis render perfectly for visual structure.
