# ðŸ§  PLT Taxonomies â€“ Orcawise  
**Research and Implementation on Semantic Analysis, Taxonomy Extraction, and Plain Language Techniques**

---

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This repository hosts research, experiments, and implementation code for **semantic analysis**, **taxonomy extraction**, and **plain language transformation** under the Orcawise PLT initiative.  
The primary goal is to improve the interpretability and consistency of language models by developing structured taxonomies and plain-language mappings for domain-specific text.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
1. Develop robust pipelines for **semantic similarity** and **taxonomy construction**.  
2. Explore **plain language techniques** for simplifying technical terminology.  
3. Conduct **model audits** to evaluate bias, consistency, and explainability in language models.  
4. Benchmark approaches using public datasets and academic resources (e.g. [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com)).

## ðŸ§  Methodology
### 1. Semantic Analysis  
- Use transformer-based models (e.g. BERT, RoBERTa) to identify and cluster semantically related terms.  
- Compute cosine similarity and build term-to-concept mappings.  

### 2. Taxonomy Extraction  
- Apply hierarchical clustering and rule-based extraction to build domain-specific taxonomies.  
- Integrate keyword taxonomy generation for better NLP model interpretability.  

### 3. Plain Language Techniques  
- Simplify complex or technical text using paraphrasing models.  
- Evaluate simplification quality via readability metrics (e.g. FKGL, SARI).

## ðŸ§® Model Audit
- Bias detection and interpretability using **SHAP** and **LIME**.  
- Evaluate model fairness, explainability, and consistency with Orcawise standards.  

---

## ðŸ”— Data Sources
- Internal Orcawise datasets (if applicable).  
- Open datasets (e.g. Wikipedia, academic corpora, PaperWithCode abstracts).  
- Domain-specific vocabularies and taxonomies (e.g. WordNet, ConceptNet).
