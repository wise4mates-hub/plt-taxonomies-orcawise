# 🧠 PLT Taxonomies – Orcawise  
**Research and Implementation on Semantic Analysis, Taxonomy Extraction, and Plain Language Techniques**

---

## 📘 Overview
This repository hosts research, experiments, and implementation code for **semantic analysis**, **taxonomy extraction**, and **plain language transformation** under the Orcawise PLT initiative.  
The primary goal is to improve the interpretability and consistency of language models by developing structured taxonomies and plain-language mappings for domain-specific text.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Develop robust pipelines for **semantic similarity** and **taxonomy construction**.  
2. Explore **plain language techniques** for simplifying technical terminology.  
3. Conduct **model audits** to evaluate bias, consistency, and explainability in language models.  
4. Benchmark approaches using public datasets and academic resources (e.g. [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com)).

🧠 Methodology
1. Semantic Analysis

Use transformer-based models (e.g. BERT, RoBERTa) to identify and cluster semantically related terms.
Compute cosine similarity and build term-to-concept mappings.

2. Taxonomy Extraction

Apply hierarchical clustering and rule-based extraction to build domain-specific taxonomies.
Integrate keyword taxonomy generation for better NLP model interpretability.

3. Plain Language Techniques

Simplify complex or technical text using paraphrasing models.
Evaluate simplification quality via readability metrics (e.g. FKGL, SARI).

### ⚙️ Explanation:
- The key fix is adding a **closing triple backtick (` ``` `)** right after the project structure tree.
- Without that, everything below is interpreted as part of the code block — causing gray background and no Markdown formatting.

---

### ✅ Quick test:
When you paste this version into your `README.md` and preview it, you should see:
- “🧠 Methodology” in **bold heading style**, not gray.
- Subheadings (1, 2, 3) as clean titles with normal text beneath.
- Proper spacing and emoji rendering.

Would you like me to add collapsible `<details>` sections next (so that “Semantic Analysis”, “Taxonomy Extraction”, etc. can expand/collapse nicely)? It looks amazing for long research documentation.
